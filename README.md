# overview

**Event Organization**: Utilizes data types, static methods, functionality and logic to reflect the process of inputting and outputting all forms of event information, such as guests, square footage of desired location, playlists, and more.

**Restuarant Finance**: Utilizes array, arraylist, and method fundamentals to calucalte a random number array based on input from the user. Parallel to that array are three others that display further information.

**Elevator Simulation**: Utilizes object-oriented programming with Java classes to simulate multiple elevators (with limits) holding multiple people. Allows multiple elevator objects to control their own list of person objects.

**Property Simulation**: Utilizes more advanced object-oriented techniques to represent complex class relationships which covers different types of buildings. Created/followed a UML Class Diagram to create the program. 

**Vacation Simulation**: A program that summarizes a culmination of object-oriented programming and design, including Sets, Maps, and Lists to store vacation information (number of passengers, passenger information, etc.). Created/followed a UML Class Diagram to create the program.
